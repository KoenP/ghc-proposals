# Proposal title

Here you should write a short abstract motivating and briefly summarizing the
proposed change.


## Motivation

Give a strong reason for why the community needs this change. Describe the use
case as clearly as possible and give an example. Explain how the status quo is
insufficient or not ideal.

A good Motivation section is often driven by examples and real-world scenarios.


## Proposed Change Specification

Specify the change in precise, comprehensive yet concise language. Avoid words
like "should" or "could". Strive for a complete definition. Your specification
may include,

* BNF grammar and semantics of any new syntactic constructs
* the types and semantics of any new library interfaces
* how the proposed change interacts with existing language or compiler
  features, in case that is otherwise ambiguous

Note, however, that this section need not describe details of the
implementation of the feature or examples. The proposal is merely supposed to
give a conceptual specification of the new feature and its behavior.

## Examples

This section illustrates the specification through the use of examples of the
language change proposed. It is best to exemplify each point made in the
specification, though perhaps one example can cover several points. Contrived
examples are OK here. If the Motivation section describes something that is
hard to do without this proposal, this is a good place to show how easy that
thing is to do with the proposal.

## Effect and Interactions

Detail how the proposed change addresses the original problem raised in the
motivation.

Discuss possibly contentious interactions with existing language or compiler
features.


## Costs and Drawbacks

Give an estimate on development and maintenance costs. List how this effects
learnability of the language for novice users. Define and list any remaining
drawbacks that cannot be resolved.


## Alternatives

List existing alternatives to your proposed change as they currently exist and
discuss why they are insufficient.


## Unresolved Questions

Explicitly list any remaining issues that remain in the conceptual design and
specification. Be upfront and trust that the community will help. Please do
not list *implementation* issues.

Hopefully this section will be empty by the time the proposal is brought to
the steering committee.


## Proposal Collaboration

Choose **one** of the following two statements (and delete the other), or write
your own that addresses this theme:

1. Writing precise specifications is hard. Accordingly, I invite the committee
   members to collaborate in writing this proposal, helping to make the specification
   of my new features as tight as possible and easiest to implement. These
   external contributions are meant to clarify my intent, not change it, and I retain
   the ability to shape the final proposal.
   
2. Writing precise specifications is hard. Accordingly, I seek to increase my
   ability to perform this skill and welcome constructive, detailed criticism
   in how to make my specification more precise. I recognize that doing so may
   take many rounds and will interpret others' advice as a way to improve my
   craft. If I get frustrated with the process, I will speak up early.


## Implementation Plan

(Optional) If accepted who will implement the change? Which other resources
and prerequisites are required for implementation?
